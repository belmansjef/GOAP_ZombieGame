<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project implements <a href="https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html">Jeff Orkin's Goal-Oriented Action Planning</a> to help an AI agent survive a virtual 2D wasteland plagued with zombies coming for you (well, your brains to be more precise, if classic comics are to be believed).

Writen in C++, using the in-house engine developed by a few talented <a href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/">DAE</a> profs.

<!-- What Is GOAP -->
<a name="what-is-goap"></a>
## What is GOAP?

If you were to ask a few hundred game developers to write down the most common way to implement AI in games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">Finite State Machines</a> (FSM) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree">Behaviour Trees</a> (BT) would surely top the charts. Almost every gameplay programmer has used, or at least heard of, Finite State Machines.

Goal-Oriented Action Planing (GOAP, rhymes with dope) is a planning architecture based on <a href="http://web.mit.edu/caelan/www/publications/rss_workshop_2017.pdf">MIT's STRIPS planning</a>. Developed by <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/">Jeff Orkin</a> while he was working at <a href="https://www.lith.com/">Monolith Productions</a>. GOAP was first implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R.">F.E.A.R.</a>, which back in 2005 was praised for it's intelligent AI and squad behaviour in which agents could seemingly verbally communicate with eachother (although the latter was all <a href="https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf#page=16">smoke and mirrors</a>).

Compared to a traditional FSM where you would need to define every single transition between every single state, which gets tedious and cumbersome real fast as the number of states/actions grow, GOAP's FSM only ever uses three states. But how could a FSM with only three states navigate an agent through a wasteland whilst fighting of zombies, making sure to avoid starvation, I hear you ask? This is where the planning comes in to play. By giving the <a href="actions">planner</a> a list of <a href="actions">actions</a>, the current <a href="states">state</a> of the world and a desired world state, it will compute a sequence of actions to be taken to achieve said desired world state.
